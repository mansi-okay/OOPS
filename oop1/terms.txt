Class is template using which instances called object are created.
Thus, class is an idea, while an object is a working version of that idea that is created and stored in memory at runtime.

The properties/attributes defined inside a class but outside any method, are called instance variables.

The "new" keyword allocates memory at runtime to create an object and returns its memory address.
So, the reference stores the address of the object, not the object itself.

A constructor is a special function in a class which has the same name as class, that runs automatically when an object is created. It sets up the object with initial values.

Keyword "this" is used inside a class to refer to the current object. It accesses that object's variables and methods.

Constructor overloading is defining multiple constructors in the same class with different parameter lists. The right one is picked and is based on the arguments passed during object creation.

Constructor chaining is calling one constructor from another

Keyword "final" is used to make something unchangeable. It can be applied to variables, methods, and classes to stop them from being modified.
